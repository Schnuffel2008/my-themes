Theme with the option to customize colors through color schemes. To change
the scheme, simply replace the corresponding default_scheme.css file in the
theme /build/css-folder with an alternative from the corresponding folders
in the /build/color_schemes/ folder.  Feel free to adjust all colors by
changing the color codes in the scheme-file or to create your own schemes.
